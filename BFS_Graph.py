it uses queue
it is a traversal technique to list down all the nodes in a graph.
Method 1-
    1- take any node from a graph
    2-it a node is connected twice then remove any one conenction
    3- now a spanning tree woul have been formed.
    4- now we have to just find the level order traversal of this tree
    5- and this traversal result would be the BFS answer
